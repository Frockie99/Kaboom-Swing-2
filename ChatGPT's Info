‚ö†Ô∏è This Game Was Built in Godot Engine and Exported to WebAssembly
Your index.js is not the game logic itself ‚Äî it's a Godot WebAssembly loader script generated when exporting a Godot game for web. That file does things like:

Load and initialize the WebAssembly .wasm file (godot.javascript.opt.debug.wasm)

Set up a fake filesystem

Start the Godot game runtime

The actual game logic is inside the WebAssembly binary file (.wasm), likely the one you saw in the /wasm/04510b42 folder.

üîç What This Means
The game was made in Godot, not directly in JavaScript or Kaboom.js.

All gameplay code, scenes, animations, and logic are compiled into godot.javascript.opt.debug.wasm.

That .wasm file is not human-readable. You‚Äôll need special tools to reverse-engineer or inspect it.
